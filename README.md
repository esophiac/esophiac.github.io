# Week 2 Assignment: Building a Personal Website
This project was to build a personal website using Hugo. I have chosen to build a website that focused on running and my plans to train for an ultramarathon.

## Rubric
The website we built should do the following:
- Effectively use the Hugo framework for static site generation
- Generate content for the website
- Straight forward navigation
- Document projects/outside content that may be relevant to the website
- The website should perform well

## Theme
The theme I used to build this website was the Gokarna theme, which can be found here: https://gokarna-hugo.netlify.app/
