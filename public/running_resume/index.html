<p>This is a list of all of the marathons I&rsquo;ve completed so far. I have also run a handful of other races like half marathons, 10 miles races, and 5ks. I attempted a 50 mile race (the JFK50) but had to DNF because of an injury. Part of the goal of this site is to help me prepare for the shorter ultramarathon (50k) that I am running in October 2025. Once I have that under my belt, I will hopefully be able tackle longer distances.</p>
<h2 id="anthem-richmond-marathon-2017"><a href="https://www.richmondmarathon.org/">Anthem Richmond Marathon (2017)</a></h2>
<p>The Anthem Richmond Marathon is a road marathon hosted in Richmond, Virginia. This marathon takes runners on a tour of the city in the late fall, providing stunning views of the state capital.</p>
<p>This was my first marathon! I really enjoyed it, and it got me hooked on long-distance running. I was worried about hitting the infamous wall at mile 20, but my training carried me through.</p>
<h2 id="rehoboth-beach-seashore-marathon-2018"><a href="https://www.rbmarathon.com/">Rehoboth Beach Seashore Marathon (2018)</a></h2>
<p>The Rehoboth Beach Seashore Marathon is a chilly marathon that takes place in the beach town of Rehoboth, Delaware. Runners will enjoy the coastal scenery in this off-season experience of the popular beach destination.</p>
<p>This marathon was difficult for me because the scenery was so un-changing and I had undertrained. Also, I kept getting sand in my shoes. I learned I need a lot more variation in order to keep my mind focused. It was really cold too! The wind would come whipping over the ocean, and the runners were the tallest things around.</p>
<h2 id="conquer-the-cove-2019"><a href="https://mountainjunkies.net/conquer-the-cove-25k-marathon/">Conquer the Cove (2019)</a></h2>
<p>Conquer the Cove is a trail marathon that tests runners to their limit through the trails of Roanoke, Virginia. Not for the faint of heart, the elevation gain and steep elevation changes will make this a challenge for runners of every stripe.</p>
<p>I think this was my favorite marathon so far. The cut-off times were so challenging, I remember thinking that I wouldn&rsquo;t finish at one point, but I did! The elevation changes were brutal though. I got myself some injuries training, so I&rsquo;ve learned to balance intensity with rest going forward.</p>
<h2 id="dopey-challenge-disney-marathon-2020"><a href="https://www.rundisney.com/events/disneyworld/disneyworld-marathon-weekend/events/challenges/">Dopey Challenge (Disney Marathon) (2020)</a></h2>
<p>The Dopey Challenge at Disney World requires runners to run every race in the Disney Race Weekend over the course of four days; 5k, 10k, half-marathon, and full marathon. The marathon takes place on the final day. Runners will explore all of the major Disney Parks and some behind the scene sites.</p>
<p>The Dopey Challenge was a lot of fun, and it was great running through Disney World around all of the landmarks. It was very flat, but Disney puts on a great show. I ran this marathon too fast to ride any of the rides, but I know a couple of people who did. Also, this marathon took place in January. Its kind of surreal now to think about all of us gathered around in a massive crowd while a couple of months later the country will shut down.</p>
<h2 id="marine-corps-marathon-2022"><a href="https://www.marinemarathon.com/">Marine Corps Marathon (2022)</a></h2>
<p>This is a classic, bucket-list worthy marathon in Washington DC. Hosted by the Marine Corp, it honors the nation&rsquo;s Marine Corp while guiding runners past the monuments of Washington DC. While the race can be challenging to enter, it is exciting to finish.</p>
<p>I initially signed up for the MCM in 2020, but then COVID happened, so I ended up getting deferred to 2022. This was a fun marathon! I&rsquo;m in the city all the time, so it wasn&rsquo;t as much of a novelty as some of the other marathons but it was great to run with the home-court advantage.</p>
<h2 id="jackson-river-marathon-2023"><a href="https://jacksonrivermarathon.com/">Jackson River Marathon (2023)</a></h2>
<p>This marathon is hosted by a small town running club in the Allegheny Mountains, meandering beside a river and through the countryside. This is a small, well-supported marathon taking place in the early summer before the heat really becomes an issue.</p>
<p>This marathon had the best aid-stations I have every seen, it was crazy. And the aid stations were really frequent too! Most of the marathons I&rsquo;ve run have been massive, so it was great to have a smaller field. It was a very picturesque route too, the river was beautiful, everything was blooming, and the weather was great.</p>
