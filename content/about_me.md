My name is Elizabeth and I am runner in the Washington DC area. I love all of the trails and opportunities to explore. You might not know it, but Washington DC and the surrounding beltway area has amazing running trails and a vibrant running community! My favorite style of running is trail running, but I end up running on pavement most of the time.

## Goals for the Future
My current goal is to complete the [Sky to Summit](https://www.runbumtours.com/skytosummit) ultramarathon in October of this year! It will certainly be a challenge. The elevation difference between where I live and the race is impressive, but so is the elevation change in the race itself. However, with the right training plan and nutrition I believe I will see the finish line.
